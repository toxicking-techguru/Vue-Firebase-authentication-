# Vue-Firebase-authentication-
This project was  pushed  in Aug 2022  based on the most recent major Vue CLI release, Vue CLI 3.0.
to start vueJs application  enter the following commands 

npm run serve
as usual i used linux when creating the project hence somehow not compatible on other OS. I advise you to change the permision of the node_modules before you start  or uninstall the node_modules when using other OS  then install new modeles.
